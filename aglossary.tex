\newglossaryentry{Association Pipeline} {name={Association Pipeline}, description={An application that matches detected Sources or DIASources or generated Objects to an existing catalog of Objects, producing a (possibly many-to-many) set of associations and a list of unassociated inputs. Association Pipelines are used in Prompt Processing after DIASource generation and in the final stages of Data Release processing to ensure continuity of Object identifiers.}}
\newglossaryentry{DIASource} {name={DIASource}, description={A DIASource is a detection with signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5 in a difference image.}}

\newacronym{DMS} {DMS} {Data Management Subsystem}
\newglossaryentry{DMTN} {name={DMTN}, description={DM Technical Note}}
\newglossaryentry{Data Management} {name={Data Management}, description={The LSST Subsystem responsible for the Data Management System (DMS), which will capture, store, catalog, and serve the LSST dataset to the scientific community and public. The DM team is responsible for the DMS architecture, applications, middleware, infrastructure, algorithms, and Observatory Network Design. DM is a distributed team working at LSST and partner institutions, with the DM Subsystem Manager located at LSST headquarters in Tucson.}}
\newglossaryentry{Data Management System} {name={Data Management System}, description={The computing infrastructure, middleware, and applications that process, store, and enable information extraction from the LSST dataset; the DMS will process peta-scale data volume, convert raw images into a faithful representation of the universe, and archive the results in a useful form. The infrastructure layer consists of the computing, storage, networking hardware, and system software. The middleware layer handles distributed processing, data access, user interface, and system operations services. The applications layer includes the data pipelines and the science data archives' products and services.}}

E.g., comets, asteroids are also Objects but typically called a Moving Object or a Solar System Object (SSObject). One of the DRP data products is a table of Objects detected by LSST which can be static, or change brightness or position with time.}}
\newglossaryentry{Prompt Processing} {name={Prompt Processing}, description={The processing that occurs at the Archive Center on the nightly stream of raw images coming from the telescope, including Difference Imaging Analysis, Alert Production, and the Moving Object Processing System. This processing generates Prompt Data Products.}}
