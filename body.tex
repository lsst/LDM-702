\section{Scope}

This Working Group is to look into image display for pipeline developers as well as \gls{QA} and commissioning staff.
It should start by 15 $^{th}$ May  2019 and conclude by 15 July 2019 with an interim report at \gls{DMLT} in June.


\section{Responsibilities}

The Working Group (\gls{WG}) has the following responsibilities:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Take note of \citeds{DMTN-085} which is the basic reason for this \gls{WG}.
 \item Take input from pipeline developers, the commissioning team and \gls{QA} staff.
 \item Identify use cases for image display in notebooks where some form of interactive overlay is needed.
 \item Identify use case for overlay and interactivity with images sin the portal.
 \item Consider if PyViz functionality is sufficient for the notebook use cases.
 \item If possible identify widget work which could be outsourced.
 \item Consider the minimal set of use cases for the portal which will be useful to 95\% of users.
 \item Consider how well firefly meets the portal needs.
 \item The \gls{WG} Chair shall convene meetings on a regular basis.
 \item The \gls{WG} will make a recommendation on minimum and desirable image display functionality, potentially identifying tools (not necessarily a single tool) which could be used in each case.
 \item The \gls{WG} will draft a report with some recommendations for the consideration of \gls{DMLT}.
\end{itemize}


\section{Specific tasks}

\subsection{Draft use case/requirements document(s)}
Consolidate and classify use cases for image display in a single document. This is not just for the \gls{LSP} but rather a cross cutting document. This should clearly identify \gls{DM} requirements and \gls{DM} desirable functionality and like wise for what may be considered non \gls{DM} requirement.
The group should decide if they wish to spend a little time on understanding the camera diagnostic display requirements, care should be taken to not spend a lot of effort to scope non \gls{DM} work however. It may be preferable to spend time consulting with camera when a consolidated list is available.
In general cost and scope should be considered.


\section{Membership}

The proposed membership is:

\begin{itemize}
